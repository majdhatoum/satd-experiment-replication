# Participant Information & Consent — SATD Annotation Study (v1.0)

**Study title.** Expert Judgement vs. AI Models for Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD)  
**Sponsor.** [Your University / Research Group]  
**Contact.** Principal Investigator: [Name, email@university.edu]. Co-investigator: [Name, email].

## 1) Purpose

You are invited to participate in a research study that compares expert judgement with an AI model on identifying and classifying Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in short software-engineering texts. Your annotations will help us understand where models align with, or diverge from, expert reasoning.

---

## 2) Procedures

- You will annotate short text snippets (code comments, commit messages, issues, PR descriptions).  
- For each snippet, you will select whether it contains SATD (yes/no/not-sure). If “yes,” you will select a single SATD type (design-debt, requirement-debt, documentation-debt, or test-debt).  
- A brief pilot/training (~10 minutes) precedes the main task. The main task takes ~45–60 minutes for 32 items.  
- Please base decisions only on the provided text and follow the annotation guideline.

## 3) Voluntary participation & withdrawal

Your participation is voluntary. You may decline to answer any item or withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits. If you withdraw, we will stop collecting data from you; you may request deletion of your contributed labels that can be uniquely attributed to you prior to de-identification/aggregation.

---

## 4) Risks and discomforts

This is a minimal-risk study. You may experience mild fatigue from reading and decision making. Take breaks as needed. There are no foreseeable physical, legal, or social risks.

---

## 5) Benefits

There is no direct personal benefit. The research may benefit the software-engineering community by improving tools and guidelines for SATD detection and by clarifying where expert input remains essential.

---

## 6) Compensation

If compensation is offered, details will be communicated to you separately (e.g., a fixed honorarium or gift card upon completion).

---

## 7) Confidentiality & data handling

- We store your labels under a participant code; your identity is kept separate and not shared in publications.  
- We do **not** redistribute license-restricted raw texts. Public releases include only stable identifiers (e.g., commit SHAs, issue/PR numbers, file paths/line ranges) and *de-identified* labels/majority gold.  
- Data are stored on secure university/approved cloud systems with access limited to the research team.  
- Aggregated results (e.g., agreement statistics, model comparisons) may be published in papers, theses, and replication packages. Individual rater identities will not be disclosed.

---

## 8) Data retention & sharing

De-identified labels, majority-vote gold, analysis code, and figure scripts may be released in an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo) and mirrored on GitHub to support reproducible research. Raw text is reconstructed locally by future users from public identifiers, subject to upstream licenses.
